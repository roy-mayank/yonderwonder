# Yonder Wonder Assignment

### Application Creation Journey
I began the application with Django. I intended to use the opencv and python's more versatile offerings when it comes to especially video processing. However, I quickly realized that passing through the learning curve of django and creating a working django backend in 40 hours would be harder than expected.
For that reason, I shifted to making an express.js + react.js. Unfortunately, I've used up all of the credits for railway, heroku and I cannot host the backend on netlify. Additionally, I also could not complete a working slider functionality on time. 

## To run locally
Navigate to the frontend folder > 'npm start' the application 
Navigate to the backend folder > 'node server.js' on terminal to run the backend web server.
